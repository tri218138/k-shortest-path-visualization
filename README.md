# k shortest path visulization

## Purpose: 
finding 3 shortest path from start point to end point  
## Demo: 
From "Truong Dai hoc Bach Khoa" to "Cho Ben Thanh" (Viet Nam)

> 1st shortest path: Green path  
> 2nd shortest path: Yellow path  
> 3rd shortest path: Blue path

## Discuss:  
> Google Map's result is lightly different from our result because:  
> Google Map using AI for reaching k fastest path according to traffic data  
> While our algorithm based on reaching k shortest path
